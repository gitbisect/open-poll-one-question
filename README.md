# Open Poll. One question

## What this does

This is an example of how to use the AWS SDK for JS to connect with DynamoDB along with how I learned to use React and JS to get there.

## What this is not

This is not code that can be used anywhere other than on your own laptop. This is because the credentials you use in your connection to DynamoDB will be visible in the Network tab of the Browser's inspect pane. In practical applications, the connection to DynamoDB must be from your backend - possibly a NodeJS application into which you connect from the browser.
